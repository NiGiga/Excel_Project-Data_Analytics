# Job Market Data Analysis with Excel

This repository hosts **advanced Excel-based data analysis** projects that explore job market datasets covering companies, countries, job types, salaries, and more. Ideal for those who want not just to crunch numbers, but to derive deep insights, make data-driven decisions, and build professional dashboards.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project aims to go beyond basic statistics, by:

- Profiling salary distributions and detecting *outliers* and *skewness*.  
- Segmenting data by country, job type, industry, and role seniority.  
- Comparing trends over time (if data allows) to spot growth or decline.  
- Building comprehensive Excel dashboards with multiple views for different stakeholders (HR, management, etc.).

## ðŸ›  Tools, Methods & Techniques

Using **Excel** with advanced features:

- Pivot tables and slicers for dynamic filtering by job type, country, company, etc.  
- Charts that go beyond bar and line: box plots, histograms, violin plots (if add-ins or manual methods are used) to show distribution.  
- Conditional formatting, custom formulas, lookup functions (VLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH) for enriching and cleaning data.  
- Scenario analysis, what-if modelling, possibly sensitivity to see how changes in one variable (e.g., cost of living) affect salary comparisons.  
- Dashboard design: combining multiple visual components to make a coherent story for different audiences.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Questions Explored

Some of the analytical angles include:

- How do salaries vary by job type **and** country?  
- What is the impact of seniority on compensation, controlling for country?  
- Which industries or companies tend to pay above median, and what attributes do they share?  
- Are there trends over time in salary growth in certain regions or job types?  
- Identifying anomalies or outliers: very high or very low salaries â€“ what explains them (company size, industry, remote work, etc.)?
